# Code an Anagram in Python
An anagram is word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.[1] For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into "nag a ram".
3 Ways to Code an Anagram
1. Checking off each letter in word 1 to see if it appears in word 2
2. Sort each word alphabetically and compare words
3. Count each letter and compare
